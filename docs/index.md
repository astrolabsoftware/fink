-   __What is Fink?__

    ---

    [Fink](https://fink-broker.org) is an astronomical alert broker that serves as an intermediary between alert issuers and the scientific community analyzing the alert data. It provides [services](broker/services_summary) designed to assist scientists in efficiently analyzing alert data from telescopes and surveys.

-   __What Fink does?__

    ---

    Among its various functions, Fink collects and stores alert data, [enriches](broker/science_modules) it with information from other surveys and catalogs, as well as user-defined enhancements like machine-learning classification scores. It also [redistributes](broker/filters) the most promising events for further analysis, including follow-up observations.

-   __How Fink is different from other brokers?__

    ---
